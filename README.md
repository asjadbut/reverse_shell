# Reverse Shell: Establishing Connections Between Computers

The "reverse_shell" project provides a straightforward way to create a network connection between two computers. At its core, this project demonstrates the fundamental principles of establishing a reverse shell, where a less privileged machine initiates a connection back to a more privileged one. This technique is often used for remote administration, penetration testing, and understanding network communication.

# The project includes code that:

* Listens for incoming connections on one machine (the attacker or handler).

* Initiates an outbound connection from another machine (the target or client) back to the listening machine.

* Once connected, allows for remote execution of commands or data transfer between the two systems.

This project is an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand how basic network sockets work and how a reverse shell operates at a foundational level.
